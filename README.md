# Programming Fundamentals Exercises

<p align="justify">
This repository contains exercises similar to those found in "Programming Fundamentals" classes taught at universities. These questions were sourced from the internet with provided answers and were originally designed for C++. I am solving them in Python as part of my learning process.
</p>

**Solving these exercises helps to learn the following topics:**

- Problem-solving with computers
- Basic Python concepts
- Developing basic programs
- Loop and conditional statements
- Program design and functions
- Recursive functions
- Debugging
- Arrays
- Characters and strings

I aim to find exercises to cover these additional areas in the future:

- File input and output
- Modular programming
- Unit testing and debugging techniques
- Clean code practices and code refactoring
- Object-oriented programming (classes)

## Note

<p align="justify">
For the array exercises, Python does not have built-in arrays like C and C++. Instead, I use lists to mimic the behavior of C and C++ arrays. The same approach applies to strings, loops, and other constructs. I try my best to mimic the behavior of C and C++ in Python, which is why the answers may not always look like typical Python solutions.
